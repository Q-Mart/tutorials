# Template - SMI
This template contains the basic requirements for creating Reconfigure.io programs. This is an alternative to our standard template and uses our SMI protocol, rather than AXI for accessing the off-chip shared memory.

Our general program structure is laid out along with some basic sections which will usually be required for your applications. Using this template is introduced in our [third tutorial](http://docs.reconfigure.io/tutorial_3_structure_comms.html).
